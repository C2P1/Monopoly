## About

This project was completed as a group project for my Software Engineering class at Montana State University, USA. We underwent an initial requirements analysis stage in which we created class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and a list of use cases. Defining the desired functionality allowed us to then pursue a Test Driven Development approach in which we wrote a comprehensive test suite for our use cases. Alongside the TDD approach, we followed an iterative development approach in which we had deliverables to submit every 3 weeks.

The finished test suite of 150 unit tests gave us 100% test coverage.
